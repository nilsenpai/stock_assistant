I'm a 23-year-old beginner investor with a moderate risk tolerance. My primary goal is long-term wealth creation. Iâ€™m interested in investing in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. I prefer technology and clean energy sectors. I'm not interested in crypto or high-risk penny stocks. I want to understand where to invest monthly and how to diversify my portfolio.
